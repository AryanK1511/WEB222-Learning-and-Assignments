/*
Write a function checkAges that takes two arguments: an Array of ages (Number); and a cut-off age (Number). Your function should return true if all of the ages in the Array are at least as old as the cut-off age: checkAges([16, 18, 22, 32, 56], 19) should return false and checkAges([16, 18, 22, 32, 56], 6) should return true. Bonus: try to rewrite your code using the Arrayâ€™s every() method.
