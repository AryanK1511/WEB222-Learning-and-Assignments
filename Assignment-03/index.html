      <!-- Basic Description of the Yellow-Rumped Warbler -->
      <div class="basic-description">
        <dfn>
          The <strong><mark>Yellow-Rumped Warbler (Setophaga Coronata)</mark></strong> is a common species of
          bird that can be observed all across the <strong>North American continent</strong>.
        </dfn>
        <p>
          These birds are concentrated in the continent’s northern parts during the breeding season
          and migrate towards southern North and Central America during winter. This species can
          generally be found in coniferous<sup>1</sup> or mixed coniferous-decidious<sup>2</sup> forests as these are their
          breeding habitats in summer. In winters they inhabit more open areas such as shrublands
          that offer food resources.  In summer, both sexes are gray with a bit of white in the wings and yellow on the face, sides and rump<sup>3</sup>. Males have bright colors whereas females may show brown and generally have dull colors. Winter birds are paler brown, with a bright yellow rump and usually some yellow on the sides. These birds usually stay in the outer tree canopies<sup>4</sup> at middle heights. They are active birds who often catch insects midair at middle heights and spend a lot of time eating berries from shrubs in winter. These birds like to travel in large flocks in winter.

        <aside id="aside-1">
          <p>The Yellow-Rumped Warbler was found to be very flexible with its foraging methods. It can stand on a branch and catch bugs midair while clinging to a tree bark and it can also skim water surfaces.</p>
        </aside>
        <p>The Yellow-rumped Warbler builds its nest anywhere from 4 to 50 feet off the ground usually in the high branches of a pine tree. Females construct this cup-like structure in approximately 10 days and occasionally use the materials offered by the males. The nests use feathers and animal hair which are curved upwards over the cup-shaped nest to partially conceal the little eggs. Their diet solely consists of insects in the summer and they spend winters in tropical locations. The Yellow-Rumped Warbler can migrate further than other warblers in winter because of its ability to digest the wax in bayberries and wax myrtles. This Warbler also eats berries of poison oak, juniper and Virginia creeper along with seeds from goldenrod and beach grasses.

        <aside id="aside-2">
            <p>They are found throughout the United States at some point in the year. Males usually forage higher in the trees than females do.</p>
        </aside>
        <p>The Yellow-rumped Warbler is one of the first birds to start eating berries in Autumn as it can digest bayberries and way myrtle berries. These Warblers get their food by picking insects from seaweed<sup>6</sup>, skimming the top of water for insects, raiding spider webs for a bite and even hunting through piles of manure.</p>

        <hr><h3>Interesting facts about warblers</h3><hr>
        <ol>
          <li>The Yellow-Rumped Warbler is one of the most common Warblers in North America and is capable of migrating farther north than any other Warbler in winter.</li>
          <li>It has the ability to digest 80% of wax-coated berries such as bayberries.</li>
          <li>The 2 types of subspecies, “Audobon” and “Myrtle”, were once considered separate species. Due to recent generic testing, the same might occur again and these two might be treated as two different species in the future. </li>
          <li>A group of warblers has many collective nouns, including a "bouquet", "confusion", "fall", and "wrench" of warblers.</li>

      <p>The Yellow-Rumped Warbler is a common bird and is nowhere near being endangered as it is widespread, and its numbers are increasing. However, this species, like many other common birds, suffers from human inventions and technology that we built.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>These birds get caught up in accidents such as collision with buildings, glass, towers and man-made structures. Adding to that, human transportation also contributes to the increase in death rates of these birds as they have less space to roam around.</li>
        <li>Communication towers also contribute a lot to the death rates of these birds. A 2013 studyshowed that, in the regions tracked, Yellow-rumped Warblers were among the top 10 species killed at communication towers.</li>
